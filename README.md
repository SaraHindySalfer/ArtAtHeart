### About the site:  
Art At Heart ðŸ–¤ is a site for selling and buying art products where anyone who creates art can put their items up for sale and also buy from their colleagues.  
At the entrance to the site there is a navigation bar .  
It is possible to register as a new member on the site or log in as a member who had registered before.  
Registration is once for each e-mail address, in the registration you must register a correct name in Hebrew or English.  
When logging in, it is necessary to enter an email address with which you have previously registered on the site and with the password.  
On the home page there are 2 buttons that lead to the main pages on the site which are selling an item and buying artwork from all the artists who have uploaded artwork in the past.  
When adding an artwork, enter the name of the artist that will be represented on the artworks that the member adds, the name of the artwork should be unique on the site, the price for the artwork that is any number greater than 0, he must also select the type of work from the given list and of course upload a picture of the artwork he is selling.  
If there are problems entering the data the system will not approve the item upload.  
When the artwork has been successfully added to the database, you can see it by navigating by artist name or by the type of art.  
when navigating by artworks, you will see that there is a buy button on the artwork,  
by clicking on this button, you are taken to the payment page for the artwork,  
Payment is secure and especially safe because of the expensive cost of the artworks on the site.  
Another thing that adds to the security of the site is that there is no saving of cookies and information,  
once the tab of the site is closed closes the information is automatically erased,    
The navigation bar also has navigation to a spectacular gallery that displays in a special way the artworks added to the site.  
After buying an item it can still be seen on display but with a tag of sold and the button leading to the purchase of the piece is inactive.  
At the bottom of the main pages of the site there are 4 links about our site in the evolving media, you can follow us there as well.
