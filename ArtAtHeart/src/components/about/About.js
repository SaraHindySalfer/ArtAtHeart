            <p className='aboutText'> With every passing year, more and more art is being sold online as
            opposed to standard settings. Even galleries themselves, traditionally
            a haven of in-person sales, are seeing more and more online
            business. In fact, some young galleries report that more than half
            their sales come online, meaning they've never met most of their
            collectors.
            <br/>
            From high priced fine art to niche crafts, more and more art lovers
            are getting used to purchasing art online. The creative arts have seen
            a slower push than some industries with online sales, but that's
            changed over the past five years. And many artists are skipping
            galleries altogether, deciding to take their work directly online and
            skipping the middleman.
            <br/>

            choices can be overwhelming. We've decided to help narrow down
            the field, explaining the ins and outs of the best channels for selling
